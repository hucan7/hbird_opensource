Hummingbirdv2 E203 Core and SoC 
================

About
-----------

This repository hosts the project for open-source Hummingbirdv2 E203 RISC-V processor Core and SoC.

This's an upgraded version of the project Hummingbird E203 maintained in SI-RISCV/e200_opensource(https://github.com/SI-RISCV/e200_opensource), so we call it Hummingbirdv2 E203, and its architecture is shown in the figure below.

In this new version, we have following updates.
* Add NICE(Nuclei Instruction Co-unit Extension) for E203 core, so user could create customized HW co-units with E203 core easily.
* Integrate the APB interface peripherals(GPIO, I2C, UART, SPI, PWM) from PULP Platform(https://github.com/pulp-platform) into Hummingbirdv2 SoC, these peripherals are implemented in System Verilog language, so it's easy for user to understand. 
* Add new development board(DDR200T) support for Hummingbirdv2 SoC. 

Welcome to visit https://www.riscv-mcu.com/community-community.html to participate in the discussion of the Hummingbird E203.

Release History
-----------------------------
#### Note at First:
    -- Many people asked if this core and SoC can be commercially used, the answer as below:
       * According to the Apache 2.0 license, this open-sourced core can be used in commercial way.
       * But the feature is not full. 
       * The main purpose of this open-sourced core is to be used by students/university/research/
         and entry-level-beginners, hence, the commercial quality (bug-free) and service of this core is not not not warranted!!!
